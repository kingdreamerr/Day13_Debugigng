## Lessons learned today

- Everyone makes bugs in their code even  experienced developers!.
- Play computer and evaluate each line of code
- Check to see what you told the computer to do not what you think you told it to do 

### Debugging:
> As a new python developer one is destined to run into bugs as they write their code and it can be very frustrating when you write code and it does not run as you thought it would... Here i share some of the debugging tips and tricks I picked.
#
## seeking out bugs with a print()
> When your code is not doing what you want it to do the print function comes in handy when you don't seem to understand what's going on
#
## Frequently run your code to check if it works
> This is a life saver because it helps you to make sure the code you are writting is working perfectly don't wait to finish writting the program then running it. You might encounter many bugs this way and debugging them might be tiresome.
#
## Take a break
> Rather than playing hide and seek with a stubborn bug/bugs get up take a walk, walk your dog or pet your cat or take a nap do something else besides looking at your code. Then come back later chances are no actually you will find that bug.
